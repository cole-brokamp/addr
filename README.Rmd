Addresses that were not validated at the time of collection are often heterogenously formatted, making them difficult to directly compare. 
The goal of addr is to clean, parse, standardize, and match messy, real-world addresses in R to use for data linkages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of addr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("cole-brokamp/addr")
```

addr requires a working [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) toolchain; install one using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Using

### addr vectors in R

The `addr` package provides the `addr` R object, which stores standardized address tags, but acts like a usual vector in R:

```{r example}
library(addr)
```

```{r}
addr(c("3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229", "202 Riva Ridge Ct Cincinnati OH 45140"))
```

Under the hood, an `addr` vector keeps a record of the tagged and standardized address components so that they can be used with other functions. To inspect or use them directly:

```{r}
addr(c("3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229", "202 Riva Ridge Ct Cincinnati OH 45140")) |>
  as.data.frame()
```

or

```{r}
addr(c("3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229", "202 Riva Ridge Ct Cincinnati OH 45140")) |>
  as.character()
```

### addr matching

List all of the potentially matching `addr`s in a reference set of `addr`s with `addr_match()`. The code below matches input addresses to the reference set of all addresses in Hamilton County, OH included in the package:

```{r}
addr(c("3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229", 
    "5130 RAPID RUN RD CINCINNATI OHIO 45238",
    "5131 RAPID RUN RD CINCINNATI OHIO 45238"
)) |>
  addr_match(cagis_addr()$cagis_addr)
```

Use the matched addr vector to merge in address-specific data in the included `cagis_addr` object.

```{r}
addr(c("3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229", "5130 RAPID RUN RD CINCINNATI OHIO 45238")) |>
  addr_match(cagis_addr()$cagis_addr) |>
  tibble::enframe(name = "input_addr", value = "ca") |>
  dplyr::left_join(cagis_addr(), by = c("ca" = "cagis_addr"))
```

If exact matching fails, use matching to TIGER street range files from the US census:

```{r}
addr(c("3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229", "5130 RAPID RUN RD CINCINNATI OHIO 45238")) |>
  addr_match_tiger_street_ranges()
```

Because the addresses are possibly located on more than one street range geography, use the `summarize` argument to return the centroid of each set of matched street ranges and then add TIGER/Line census block group identifers via geospatial intersection:

```{r}
addr(c("3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229", "5130 RAPID RUN RD CINCINNATI OHIO 45238")) |>
  addr_match_tiger_street_ranges(county = "39061", summarize = "centroid") |>
  dplyr::bind_rows() |>
  dplyr::mutate(census_bg_id = tiger_block_groups(s2::as_s2_cell(s2_geography)))
```

The above process is conducted, with default matching arguments, in the function `addr_match_geocode`, which requires a vector of reference s2 cell locations:  **As of now, this process only works with the `cagis_s2` available as below and for matching within Hamilton County, OH (36061) using 2022 TIGER street range files**

```{r}

# select one s2 cell at random from addresses with more than one parcel identifier and coordinates
cagis_s2 <-
   cagis_addr()$cagis_addr_data |>
   purrr::modify_if(\(.) length(.) > 0 && nrow(.) > 1, dplyr::slice_sample, n = 1) |>
   purrr::map_vec(purrr::pluck, "cagis_s2", .default = NA, .ptype = s2::s2_cell())
   
addr_match_geocode(x = sample(voter_addresses(), 100), 
                   ref_addr = cagis_addr()$cagis_addr,
				   ref_s2 = cagis_s2,
				   county = "39061",
				   year = "2022")
```
